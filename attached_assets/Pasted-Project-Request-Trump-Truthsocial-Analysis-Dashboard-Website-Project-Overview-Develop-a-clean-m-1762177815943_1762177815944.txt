Project Request: Trump Truthsocial Analysis Dashboard Website
Project Overview:
Develop a clean, modern, and user-friendly web application that visualizes and allows detailed filtering of Donald Trump tweet analysis data based on the provided Excel file (merged_all_excel.xlsx). The website should support dynamic data refresh to reflect updates in the Excel data.

Data Source
Excel file: merged_all_excel.xlsx (Sheet Sheet1)

Key columns include:

timestr / time: Tweet date and time

content: Full tweet text

url: Link to original tweet

platform: Tweet source platform (e.g., Truth Social)

originaltweet: Indicator if original or retweet

impactonmarket: Market impact category (Direct, Indirect, None)

sentimentscore: Sentiment score (range approx. -1 to +1)

marketimpactscore: Score measuring estimated market impact

keywords: Associated keywords, comma separated

sector: Related market sectors, comma separated

reason: Brief explanation of market impact

Core Functional Requirements
1. Data Table & Filtering

Display all tweets in a sortable, searchable table.

Enable multi-criteria filtering by:

Date range (using timestr/time)

Sentiment score range

Market impact category (impactonmarket)

Sector

Keywords

Clicking a tweet row shows modal or expandable detail view with full content and clickable original tweet URL.

2. Interactive Visualizations

Sentiment and market impact score distributions (histograms, boxplots).

Trendline charts of sentiment/market impact over time.

Keyword/sector frequency visualization (bar charts, pie charts).

Highlight the number of tweets over time and by impact category.

3. Dynamic Data Refresh

When the underlying Excel file is updated (new data rows appended), the website should:

Immediately or on manual “Refresh” button click reload and display the latest data.

Always show tweets sorted by latest date/time descending.

Display a visible “Last Updated” timestamp on the UI indicating data freshness.

(Optional) Auto-refresh capability every few minutes to check for new data and update the display.

4. User Experience & Design

Clean, minimalist, and professional design using a white and blue color scheme.

Responsive layout adaptable for desktop and mobile.

Korean language support for UI labels and instructions.

5. Export & Download Options

Allow users to export filtered dataset to CSV or Excel from the website.

(Optional) Download capability for charts or dashboard snapshots as image files.

Technical Specifications
Frontend: React.js, Vue.js, or another modern SPA framework suitable for Replit environment.

Visualization libraries: Chart.js, Plotly, D3.js as applicable.

Backend: Python Flask, FastAPI, or Node.js REST API to handle:

Excel file loading/parsing (using pandas or equivalent).

Data filtering and delivery through API endpoints.

Support for real-time data reload on file update or manual trigger.

Performance optimized for rapid response on dataset (~7,000+ rows).

Well-documented and modular codebase with comments for maintainability.

User Workflow Example
Upload or locate the latest merged_all_excel.xlsx data file on the server.

Browse the complete tweet list, apply filters for “Direct market impact” and sentiment score below -0.5.

Visualize the sentiment trend over the last 3 months and sector distribution for filtered tweets.

Click on tweet entries to read full text and navigate to the original tweet link.

Export filtered data to CSV for further analysis.

Refresh the data anytime to load the newest tweets appended to the Excel file.

Additional Notes
Design should allow easy future addition of sentiment models or new metrics.

Emphasize stability in handling file I/O and concurrent user access.

Provide initial setup and deployment instructions for running on Replit.

Please include estimated development time and rough cost estimate.
